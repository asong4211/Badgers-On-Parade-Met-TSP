    "## Motivation:\n",
    "- Recently, my school (University of Wisconsin Madison) brought 85 life-size Bucky Badger statue to the streets of Madison[1]. They all spread out across the campus and I thought it would be interesting to visit them all. I thought I can use some solvers to find the optimal shortest path that visit all of them and come back to where I started.\n",
    "- This problem can be thought of as the **Travel Salesman Problem** (TSP), which is given a list of cities and distance between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and return to the origin city. The TSP problem is NP-Hard, which means the worst case running time to find the optimal solution might take exponential amounts of time because the search space or possible solutions are so huge. In this case, given that we have 85 statues, the running time is 85!, which is $ 2.8 \\times 10^{128} $.\n",
    "- Although the problem is NP-Hard, it is still solved on the daily basis by a lot of big companies with millions of different cities. There have been many research in optimiation that use relaxation or some other heuristics to find an optimal solution.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even though there are 85 different statues, only 54 are around the University of Wisconsin campus. Some of them are spread out on the Northeast side of the campus. Hence, in this project, I will only be interested in the 54 of them that are around the campus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since all the location of the statues are published on their official website, I took all 55 of them and dumped them into a csv file. In \"location.csv\" I have all these information.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The Miller-Tucker-Zemlin Formulation was supposed to be slow since it would have n^2 variables but actually was able to solve it in under 30 minutes, while the subtour elimination method was supposed to be much faster but takes many many iterations to solve (more than 2 hours with 100+ iterations and still were not able to solve it).\n",
    "- In general, TSP is a really hard problem, as we can see here. Even though using some sorts of relaxation, it might work for small numbers of n, but as n gets a little bigger, the algorithm was not able to scale very well. Some of the industry used algorithm also takes advantage of the structure of the map to write more specific program to solve the problem.\n",
    "- While I was using the result of this to actually find the badger status, I notice that some of the path is not making sense realistically. For example, two of the statues were facing each other in the exact place, the algorithm still tells me to go some other place before coming back to the second statues that sit about the exact same place.\n"
